# @ledewire/node

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f89cd38: fix: move @ledewire/core to devDependencies

  @ledewire/core is a private, internal package that is fully bundled into the
  output of @ledewire/browser and @ledewire/node at build time. Having it listed
  under `dependencies` caused npm/yarn/pnpm consumers to receive an unresolvable
  package error on install, since @ledewire/core is never published to the registry.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1eb6e40: Add support for external_ref content type (Vimeo, YouTube, PDFs, etc.)

### Patch Changes
